# Modeling and Simulation of Systems

This repository contains various exercises and projects related to modeling and simulation of physical and abstract systems. Each exercise focuses on a different concept, ranging from motion simulations to system dynamics. The exercises are implemented primarily in Python and MATLAB.

## Exercises

### 1. Projectile Simulation with Boundary Conditions
This exercise simulates the motion of a projectile while considering "good" and "bad" regions. It computes the trajectory based on initial velocity and angle, and checks whether the trajectory crosses specified regions. The system plots valid trajectories and calculates the probability of hitting valid regions.
